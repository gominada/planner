# 🗓️ **Planner** - A Productivity Daily Scheduler

**Planner** is not your average to-do list. Instead of just listing tasks, it helps you allocate specific hours to your tasks, ensuring a more structured and effective approach to productivity. By organizing your day hour-by-hour, Planner helps you prioritize and stay on track, making it a powerful alternative to traditional to-do lists.

🌟 **Key Feature**:  
**Bubbles!** 🫧 Yes, you read that right. Each task is represented by a bubble, and when you pop a bubble, you complete the task. It's like popping bubbles to clear your day! So why not make productivity a little more fun, right? 🫧🎉
