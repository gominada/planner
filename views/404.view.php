  <h2>Oops! We’ve Lost Your Schedule!</h2>

  <h1>🗓️ 404 - Page Not Found 🗓️</h1>

  <p>It seems like the page you were looking for took an unexpected detour, just like a meeting that got double-booked. But don’t worry, we’re on it! You can go back to planning your day, or take a breather while we handle the glitch.</p>

  <p>🔄 Try These Instead:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="/">View Your Planner</a></li>
        <li>Take a Coffee Break ☕ (you deserve it)</li>
    </ol>

  <p>We’ll make sure this doesn't end up on the schedule again. 😎</p>
